# ðŸŽ² FluentSQL

Project developed based on the "Live #1 - Design Patterns Fluent Interface and  Builder" on [Erick Wendel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvamncn_wG0)'s youtube channel.

The main objective of this project is create a library using TDD to demonstrate the Fluent Interface standard and create a database access utility and also create custom commands to simulate what a database driver does to manipulate data, creating commands such as select, where, sort and limit.
